                    1.1. The Future of Higher Education
                  </h4>
                  <p class="body-text">
                    The Higher education existed in the Greek and Roman empires
                    well before the modern universities came into existence in
                    the Middle Ages (Haskins, 1965). Society has continued to
                    value the contribution of higher education institutions in
                    the centuries since. However, as societies have changed and
                    developed, societal expectations of higher education
                    institutions have not remained constant. The resilience of
                    higher education, given the many challenges to it, including
                    the rapid and wide-spread technological advancements in
                    society is considered remarkable (Flavin, 2017). Higher
                    education institutions have had to continually adapt to
                    their changing environment based on its support for future
                    innovation and productivity, and it is considered to be a
                    strong predictor of a country’s economic prosperity (OECD,
                    2018), on the basis of its contribution to research and
                    development (Zapp, 2017).

                  <p class="body-text">
                    <span class="paragraph"></span>The world today is changing
                    at an unprecedented pace, and the world is experiencing a
                    paradigm shift worldwide with the digital transformation of
                    higher education. It would perhaps be unwise to assume that
                    COVID-19 will be the last global emergency of its kind, and
                    that there will be no need for future generations to learn
                    the lessons of the pandemic. A paradigm shift must take
                    place in the global education system worldwide by narrowing
                    the education-industry knowledge and skill gap. The focus
                    has shifted from employment to employability; that is,
                    educating students so they are capable of evolving and
                    adapting to any changes that may arise. This is no small
                    task but one that higher education is well-suited for. This
                    will require input from students, faculty, employers and
                    government authorities. Part of this paradigm shift entails
                    shifting the focus from a competence-based learning model to
                    a lifelong-lifewide learning model, which is critical in an
                    intensely competitive and highly fluid knowledge-based
                    economy and society (Blessinger et al., 2022). One of the
                    major goals of any higher education institution is to make
                    their students employable so that they can successfully
                    survive the labour market of the future. However, this
                    requires that higher education institutions focus on
                    preparing students for continuous learning (that is,
                    lifelong-lifewide learning). The soft skills required to
                    survive in the labour market of the future include
                    resilience, critical thinking, creative thinking, green
                    skills, while OECD, 2017 agreed that in addition,
                    problem-solving, and social and emotional skills, such as
                    teamwork, communication and cultural awareness are also
                    essential among others. To this end, the curricula should be
                    updated to reflect this reality.
                  </p>
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <span class="paragraph"></span>Higher education today is
                    viewed as the prime educational mechanism for creating
                    work-ready graduates for a knowledge-based society (Nerland
                    et al., 2018). The success of a higher education institution
                    and its teaching is being assessed by observers in terms of
                    graduates’ employability in society (Osborne and
                    Grant-Smith, 2017). Despite the many potential benefits
                    associated with completing a higher education degree, for
                    most students their motivation to complete a higher
                    education degree is based on the belief of greater
                    employment opportunities (Norton et al., 2019). The
                    institutions are being transformed to focus on satisfying
                    student and employer needs, and many programmes are becoming
                    more skill-based in orientation to provide appropriate
                    competencies for future professions (Fuchs and Henning,
                    2017; Milburn-Shaw and Walker, 2017). The use of digital
                    technologies is being mandated by higher education
                    institutions to allow teachers to enhance their teaching
                    practices and to ensure students are equipped with
                    knowledge, skills, and dispositions for working in the 21st
                    century (Nykvist and Mukherjee, 2016).

                    <span class="paragraph"></span>The power of education is to
                    bring about profound change.The pandemic has only served to
                    prove our fragility and our interconnectedness. Now urgent
                    action, taken together, is needed to change course and
                    reimagine our futures. UNESCO (2021) agreed that a critical
                    step towards reimagining our futures is to forge a new
                    social contract (an implicit agreement among members of a
                    society to cooperate for shared benefit) for education that
                    aims to rebuild our relationships with each other, with the
                    planet, and with technology, and allow us to think
                    differently about learning and the relationships between
                    students, teachers, knowledge, and the world and that will
                    help us build peaceful, just, and sustainable futures for
                    all.

                  <p class="body-text">
                    <span class="paragraph"></span>The pandemic has shown that
                    education is fragile: At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
                    1.6 billion learners were affected by school closures across
                    the globe. The impact of covid-19 pandemic on higher
                    education include the temporal cessation of on-campus
                    activities within countries, across borders, and
                    institutions (Altbach and de Wit, 2020). COVID-19 speeded up
                    the transformation processes already underway, but it was
                    important to demonstrate the value added by online learning
                    and he would focus more on innovation and developing
                    entrepreneurial attitudes and breaking down barriers between
                    different academic departments (Mitchell, 2020). (UNESCO
                    (2020) acknowledges that in the absence of contingency plans
                    for the immediate shift to remote learning, higher education
                    institutions resulted in ad hoc closure which disrupted
                    academic calendars. Those who seek to restore the past as if
                    COVID-19 never happened and changed the way students learn,
                    faculty and staff work, institutions operate, and what the
                    public expects from universities are doomed to lag and miss
                    the train to the future (Zeleza, 2022).

                  <p class="body-text">
                    <span class="paragraph"></span>The World Bank (2020)
                    cautions that a large-scale shift to online learning is a
                    complex undertaking for education systems, even in the best
                    of circumstances. Moving into the future, a combination of
                    face-to-face and online learning may be the new norm. In an
                    academic program, theoretical components may be offered
                    online even when students are on-campus. As universities
                    learn from their experiences and best practices elsewhere,
                    technology may be deliberately, progressively, and
                    extensively infused into delivering practical subjects
                    including sciences, technology, and mathematics. Higher
                    education institutions must therefore be persuaded to
                    embrace bimodal delivery of academic programs and make
                    access to online education more affordable, convenient, and
                    engaging to learners from all walks of life (Amemado, 2020).
                    This paradigm shift will demonstrate the commitment of
                    higher education institutions in leveraging technology to
                    facilitate flexible, adaptive learning environments and
                    empowering the youth with handson digital literacy which is
                    a key ingredient in the actualization of sustainable
                    development goals (Dhawan, 2020). The four (4) trends that
                    will shape the future of higher education include: Learning
                    from everywhere, Replacing lectures with active learning,
                    Teaching skills that remain relevant in a changing world and
                    Using formative assessment instead of high-stake exams
                    (Teich, 2022, WEF, 2022). To be successful, higher education
                    reform should look at what is being taught (curriculum), how
                    (pedagogy), when and where (technology and the real world)
                    and whom we are teaching (access and inclusion). The World
                    Economic Forum believes that once institutions are ready to
                    address these issues, they will succeed in transforming
                    higher education. Kara (2021) suggested that Higher
                    education institutions should strategically invest in
                    Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
                    infrastructure and
